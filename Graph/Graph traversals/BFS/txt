# Breadth-First Search (BFS)
What is BFS?

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph/tree traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors first, then moves level by level away from the source node.

Key Idea (One Line)

BFS visits nodes in increasing order of distance from the start node.

How BFS Works (Step-by-Step)

Start from a source node

Put it into a queue

Mark it as visited

Repeatedly:

Dequeue a node

Visit all its unvisited neighbors

Enqueue those neighbors

Data Structure Used

Queue (FIFO) ← this is what makes BFS level-by-level
