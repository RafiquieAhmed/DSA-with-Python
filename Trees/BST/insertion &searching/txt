DSA Learning Journey | Day 11

Continuing my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey 📚

Today, I learned about Binary Search Trees (BST) and focused on insertion and searching operations, understanding how BST properties help in faster data access.

📌 What I learned today:

✅ What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)

Left subtree values < Root

Right subtree values > Root

✅ BST Insertion

Placing nodes based on BST rules

Recursive and iterative thinking

✅ BST Searching

Efficient search with average time complexity O(log n)

Comparison with linear search in arrays and linked lists
